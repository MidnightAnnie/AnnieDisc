Discord Video Crash

## How its done.

Drag and drop the Video onto either the bat or the .exe whatever you decide to get.
Just make sure you put in the [Correct time format](https://i.imgur.com/S5BHdms.png) when it asks

## What it does.

split the video into two parts, The split is when it will crash.

then encode one video with yuv420p while the other with yuv444p.

Then its pretty much done merge both files with concat and done.

## FYI
 If you gonna use the bat version make sure you put [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in the same dir and the bat

As for the exe its all good ffmpeg is built into it
