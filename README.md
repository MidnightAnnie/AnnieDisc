Discord Video Crash

How its done

Drag and drop the Video onto either the bat or the .exe whatever you decide to get

I split the video into two parts, The split is when it will crash

I then encode one video with yuv420p while the other with yuv444p

Then its pretty much done merge both files with concat and your done


You could grab the bat file and get ffmpeg and do it like that

or get the .exe that has it all in one
