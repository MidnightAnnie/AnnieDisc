Discord Video Crash

How its done.
Drag and drop the Video onto either the bat or the .exe whatever you decide to get.

What it does.
split the video into two parts, The split is when it will crash.

then encode one video with yuv420p while the other with yuv444p.

Then its pretty much done merge both files with concat and done.

You could grab the bat file and get ffmpeg and do it like that

or get the .exe that has it all in one
